# TODO
# - Fix Challenges class. Everything in there is mess
#   - Challenge.challenge should be the "everything" function, and should create games if successful
#   - Need to check if game exists as well as if challenge exists
#   - Add proper error checking
# - Standardize dtypes in args and returns (either add them EVERYWHERE or NOWHERE!)
# - Docstrings need double checking, especially for possible errors. Both for Game and Challenges
